# NBA Data Analysis

##Project introduction
   
   This project aims to demonstrate my skills of scraping data, cleaning data, graphing data, and forming stories from data. In order to do so, I picked my favorite sport, basketball, and use the data from [NBA Stats](http://stats.nba.com/) to create some analyis. For the purpose of this project, I use shot chart data(shots from different shot location, shot region,..etc) and shot dashboard data(shots by time on shotclock, distance from closest defender,..etc) of ten best players of the league in my opinion. The project was broken into three parts, described as below:
    
    1. Grabbing NBA data - The goal for this part is to scrape raw data from [NBA Stats](http://stats.nba.com/) using API, and clean the scraped Json format data into nice and clean CSV files.
    
    2.
